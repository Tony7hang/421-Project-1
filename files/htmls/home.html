        <p> Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, 
            Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. </p>

        <p> There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the 
            process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in 
            writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps. </p>

        <p> If you are new to writing research papers, this course will guide you through each of the basic steps; even if 
            you are an experienced writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons. To begin, choose
