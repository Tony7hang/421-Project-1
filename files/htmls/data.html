            <p> For this lesson, you'll need the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Microsoft Excel </li>
                    <li> PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download </li>
                </ul>

            <p> You should already be familiar with: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The basic functions and tools of Excel </li>
                    <li> <em class = "blue"> Descriptive statistics </em> and <em class = "blue"> inferential statistics </em> 
                        </li>
                    <li> Research design and how to identify <em class = "blue"> independent variables </em> and <em class = "blue">

        </aside>

        <p> This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research 
            projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis </li>
                <li> Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel </li>
                <li> Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW </li>

        <h2> Format data for analysis </h2>

        <p> Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document 
            <a href = "../tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx"> ToolBox_DataLesson.xls </a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, 
            taking action as instructed. In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the 
            first row of each column. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Each variable name must be different from other variable names. </li>
                <li> The first variable (in column A) is a <em class = "blue"> unique identifier </em>. </li>
                <li> Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change 
                    <span class = "italics"> 4tutorial_types </span> to <span class = "italics"> tutorial_types </span>. </li>
                <li> Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <span class = "italics"> use </span> 
                    and <span class = "italics"> useful </span> to <span class = "italics"> perc_ease_of_use </span> and 
                    <span class = "italics"> perc_usefulness </span>, respectively. </li>
                <li> Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers 
                    to <span class = "italics"> Perceived Usefulness </span> and Column G refers to <span class = "italics"> 
                    Perceived Ease of Use </span>. </li>
            </ol>
        
        <figure>
            <cite> Figure 1 </cite>

            <figcaption> CAPTION: Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as 
                dichotomous variables. </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <span class = "italics"> gender </span>, change the 
                    "female" value to "F". </li>
                <li> Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example, 
                    <span class = "italics"> tasks_completed </span> values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. 
                    So, add columns <span class = "italics"> task1, task2 </span>, and <span class = "italics"> task3 </span>, 
                    and reformat values appropriately. </li>
                <li> Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old <span class = "italics">
                    tasks_completed </span> column.
                </li>
                <li> Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2. </li>
            </ol>    

        <figure>
            <cite> Figure 2 </cite>
            <img src = "../illustrations/datalesson_fig2.png" alt = "data lession figure 2 png">
            <figcaption> CAPTION: Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p> Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the value is represented 
            for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values <em class = "blue"> dichotomous </em>, which gives 
            the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or correlations. </p>

        <aside>
            <p> Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis. For example, separating 
                <em> experience </em> levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low experience have 
                <em> perceived ease of use </em> scores significantly different from those with medium and high experience 
                levels. </p>
        </aside>

        <ol>
            <li> Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data. </li>
            <li> In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <span class = "bolds"> Insert > Columns </span> for each 
                distinct value in categorical data columns (<span class = "italics"> tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, 
                task2, </span> and <span class = "italics"> task3 </span>). You do not have to add a new column for 
                <span class = "italics"> task1, task2, </span> and <span class = "italics"> task3 </span> because their 
                values are already dichotomous. </li>
            <li> Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values from the original 
                column. </li>
            <li> Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: <span class = "bolds"> 
                Edit > Replace </span>. </li>
            <li> Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Run descriptive statistics </h2>

        <aside>
            <p> Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <span class = "italics"> 
                perc_enjoy </span> is much higher on average than <span class = "italics"> perc_usefulness </span>, which 
                also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful 
                even though they enjoyed using it. </p>
        </aside>

        <p> Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, 
            rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <em class = "blue"> continuous </em> values, are 
            adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <span class = "italics"> perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness </span>, 
            and <span class = "italics"> perc_ease_of_use </span> are already adjacent.) </p>
        <p> Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable 
            labels. </p>
