        <p> This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. 
            in Technical Communication program who want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, 
            this lesson is designed to give students strategies which will help them research more efficiently. </p>

        <div class = "sub-section">
            <h3 id = "research-2-1"> Accessing Library Services </h3>

            <p> If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be 
                found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services. </p>
            
            <p> Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions 
                through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin 
                Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "sub-section">
            <h3 id = "research-2-2"> Using myIIT to Access the Library Website </h3>

            <p> Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access 
                the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library 
                Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link. </p>

                <img src = "../illustrations/research2.jpg" alt = "Image guide to library website">
                <figcaption> CAPTION: The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access 
                most resources without reentering your login information. </p>
            
            <p> Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand 
                navigation bar. </p>

            <p> The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly 
                journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO). </p>

        <div class = "sub-section">
            <h3 id = "research-3-1"> Formulating a timeline </h3>

            <p> It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have 
                enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish 
                your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource 
                for your paper: </p>

            <p> <span class = "bolds"> Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your 
                project &lt; Remaining time before deadline </span> </p>
