            <p> If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be 
                found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services. </p>
            
            <p> Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions 
                through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin 
                Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started. </p>
        </div>

            <h3 id = "research-2-2"> Using myIIT to Access the Library Website </h3>

            <p> Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access 
                the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library 
                Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link. </p>

            </figure>

            <p> Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access 
                most resources without reentering your login information. </p>
            
            <p> Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand 
                navigation bar. </p>

            <p> The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly 
                journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO). </p>

            <h3 id = "research-3-1"> Formulating a timeline </h3>

            <p> It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have 
                enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish 
                your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource 
                for your paper: </p>

            <p> <span class = "bolds"> &emsp; Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your 
                project &lt; Remaining time before deadline </span> </p>

            <p> Let's unpack some of those terms. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> Time to obtain resource </span>: </p>
                        <p> &emsp; How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? <span class = "italics"> 
                            -or- </span> How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource? </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> Time to read resource </span>: </p> 
                        <p> &emsp; How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where 
                            you must begin to write if you want to finish on time? </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> Time to integrate resource into your project </span>: </p> 
                        <p> &emsp; Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information 
                            and incorporate that information into your project? If your paper is already written, do you 
                            have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this resource, or would it simply 
                            be better to indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that time constraints 
                            prevented you from including it? </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> Remaining time before deadline </span>: </p> 
                        <p> &emsp; How much time is left before you must turn in your project? Is your resource powerful enough to 
                            cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, requesting an extension might be in 
                            order. </p> </li>
                </ul>

                <h4> Being Realistic </h4>
                <p> Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting 
                    your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research 
                    timeline. </p>

            <h4> Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline </h4>

            <p> Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research 
                paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field 
                between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II. </p>

            <p> Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases 
                like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search 
                topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that she must decide whether 
                it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or to move on and look for resources that are more easily 
                available. To do this, she constructs a research timeline. </p>

            <p> Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides 
                to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements 
                of her project should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to request 
                any resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have sufficient time to wait for 
                resources to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has learned into her paper before she must turn in 
                her final copy. She decides to read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover 
                her topic as appropriate. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "sub-section">
            <h3 id = "research-3-2"> Determining the best way to obtain resources </h3>

            <p> Even if you can obtain a resource, that doesn't mean you necessarily should spend your time doing so. Be sure 
                to preview a resource by reading a book review or previewing the book on Google Books to make sure that it 
                is valuable enough to obtain. If you have determined that it is feasible and worthwhile to obtain a resource 
                within the timeline you have developed, you must next consider how to obtain that resource. </p>

            <p> In general, the safest way to obtain resources is to physically obtain a copy yourself. However, that is often 
                inconvenient, impractical, or unnecessary. In cases such as those, interlibrary loan or MyILL is your best 
                option. However, interlibrary loan can take time. Consider these guidelines when requesting your resource 
                through interlibrary loan or MyILL. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> The stated turnaround time </span> </p>
                        <p> Problems can and do occur in transmitting library materials. For safety's sake, ask yourself the 
                            following question: "If it were to take twice as long as the stated turnaround time on the website, 
                            would I still have enough time to utilize the research?" Consider all of the factors in the formula 
                            above. If not, seek an alternative to interlibrary loan or MyILL. </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> The proximity of the lending library to your location </span> </p>
                        <p> In the case of MyILL, articles are delivered exclusively online. However, if you are using WorldCat, 
                            your lending library may be located in Wisconsin, or it may be located in Canada, or Bulgaria, 
                            or Hong Kong. While chapters might be sent electronically, it takes time for books to be delivered 
                            from WorldCat libraries. Check the location of the lending library and take it into consideration 
                            when requesting materials from WorldCat. </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <span class = "bolds"> The possibility that your materials may not arrive before your deadline 
                                </span> </p>
                        <p> Can you complete your project without these materials? If you are still in the planning or topic 
                            selection phase, check for these materials and consider whether you will have enough time to utilize 
                            them in your project. If not, it would be wise to consider an alternative topic. </p> </li>

            <p> Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you will need to register before 
                you are able to request an article. Think of myILL as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you, 
                because that is essentially what you are doing. You will be notified by email when your article is ready to 
                download, and you can log into myILL and view your page of delivered items. For more help requesting articles, 
                see the Library FAQ and How-to Pages. </p>

            <h3 id = "research-4-2"> Requesting a Book From Another Library </h3>

            <p> When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library system. If you are unsuccessful 
                in finding the title you are looking for, next try to locate the book in <em class = "blue"> I-Share </em>. 
                If I-Share yields no results, the next step is to search for your book in <em class = "blue"> WorldCat </em>.

            <aside>
                <h4> Being Realistic </h4>

                <p> When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember any of the titles you look up or that you 
                    will be able to find them again using past searches. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or on 
                    your flash drive. </p>
            </aside>

            <p> If you are confused when using any of the library systems, you can always refer back to the Library FAQ and 
                How-to Pages which have a selection of tutorials explaining the step-by-step instructions for requesting

            <h4> Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources </h4>

            <p> Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them. One of the resources that Jane 
                finds quoted often in academic papers is the 1923 text <cite> English for Engineers </cite> written by S. A. 
                Harbarger. She decides that this is a useful resource to examine for her project, and makes a note of the title, 
                author, and year in her Google Docs list of resources that she is compiling. After a quick search in I-Share, 
                she notices that it is available at the University of Illinois library in Chicago; she makes a note of this 
                as well in her list of resources. Although she has to work on another project, she knows that she can easily 
                come back to her research notes and resume work. </p>

            <p> Not all area libraries belong to the I-Share system. For instance, Loyola University and the University of 
                Chicago do not participate in I-Share. You may check out books, but only under certain conditions. You may

                <p> Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break 
                    or you are not allowed to browse the stacks as a non-student. When in doubt, call first. </p>

            <p> The Chicago Public Library (CPL) system is extensive, and contains a great deal of books that are in popular 
                demand or hard to obtain from I-Share libraries (e.g. textbooks). If you do not live in Chicago, you cannot 
                check books out of the library, but you can visit the library and read or copy the books. Most local libraries 
                have similar policies. Visit a CPL location to obtain a library card (you will need to present proof of 
                residency). </p>

            <h4> Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library </h4>

            <p> After finishing another project, Bridgette returns to her research paper on Tech Comm prior to World War II. 
                She notices that she had made a note to obtain <cite> English for Engineers </cite> by S. A. Harbarger, but 
                that was over a week ago and she now only has ten days left to finish her paper. She decides to reassess her 
                research timeline and concludes that she has enough time to read, analyze, and incorporate important elements 
                of this resource into her paper, but in order to do so, she must have the resource and begin working immediately. 
                </p>
            
            <p> Recognizing the need for an adjustment in the amount of time it takes her to obtain the resource, she decides 
                to attempt to pick up the book herself from a local library. She sees a note she made that the book is available 
                at the UIC library; since she has the title, author, local library, and call number, she is ready to proceed 
                to the library. Prior to leaving, however, she checks the hours and policies of the UIC library on their website 
                so she doesn't waste a trip. </p>

            <h3 id = "research-5-3"> When to Use Local Library Resources Instead of Interlibrary Loan </h3>

            <p> There are two situations where you should consider obtaining your resource through a local library rather 
                than relying on interlibrary loan: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> You no longer have enough time to wait for an interlibrary loan book to be delivered </li>
                    <li> You cannot obtain the book through interlibrary loan because it is not available </li>
                </ol>

            <p> It is important to remember that CPL volumes are not listed in I-Share holdings information. Even though 
                public libraries are located in Illinois, they do not participate in the I-Share system, so you must search 
                at the CPL website to view available titles. </p>

            <p> In the final section of this lesson we'll explore the best way to obtain resources, the internet. </p>

            <h3 id = "research-6-1"> Some resources to consider </h3>

            <p> If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some resources that are available online include: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Public domain writings </li>
                    <li> Resources licensed under Creative Commons </li>
                    <li> Media files such as video, audio, and images </li>
                </ul>

            <p> In general, if you can avoid making a trip to the library, you can save yourself time when researching. </p>

        <div class = "sub-section">
            <h3 id = "research-6-2"> Using Web Resources for Research </h3>

            <p> Some web resources can help you find additional resources, such as the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en"> Google Scholar </a> </p>
                        <p> Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles are cited by other articles 
                            </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <a href = "http://books.google.com/books"> Google Books </a> </p>
                        <p> Allows you to view a preview of a book, or in some cases, the entire book, including the references 
                            section </p> </li>

                    <li> <p> <a href = "http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science"> 
                                Web of Science </a> </p>
                        <p> Similar to Google Scholar, but for scientific papers </p> </li>
                </ul>

            <aside>
                <h4> Being Realistic </h4>

                <p> If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, 
                    yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. Collections such as these offer you a wealth of resources and 
                    represent a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic, which can help you determine how your own topic 
                    relates to that research. </p>
            </aside>

            <h4> Case Study: Using Web Resources </h4>

            <p> Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to question some of the arguments in a central 
                article in her paper, "The Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America" by R.J. Connors (1982). She wants 
                to see if other researchers have included atypical examples of technical writing instruction in their papers 
                about the rise of Technical Communication as a discipline before World War II. Thinking that most articles 
                written on this topic will have referenced Connors article, she types the title into Google Scholar. She notices 
                that Connors' article has been cited 62 times. From there, she searches the articles that cite Connors' article 
                for the examples she is looking for </p>
